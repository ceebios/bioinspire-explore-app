    title: 'Paleo-bioinspiration and the jaws of fish',
    text: `In a 2012 paper in Scientific Reports, Grubich et al. describe the clamping forces exerted by the jaws of two Miocene-era piranha relatives, one present and one extinct. These clamping forces, among the most important developed by Life, functionally demonstrate, through measurements and simulations, the extraordinary efficiency of the bite of these past and present Amazonian fishes, and provide a mechanistic justification for their predatory dominance.`,

    title: 'AntBot, the ant robot',
    text: `Desert ants are able to explore their environment randomly over several hundred metres and then return to their starting point in a straight line with great precision.     They are the inspiration for Antbot, a six-legged robot that can walk to explore its environment. As it travels, a rotating sensor records the variations in polarised UV rays in the sky. This 'optical compass' consists of just two rotating pixels and two polarising filters, which are enough to guide the robot back to its starting point with an accuracy of about 10cm, a fraction of the robot's size. Antbot's guidance system does not require satellite geolocation, and continues to work under more or less cloudy skies, or even under trees or buildings.`,

    title: 'Mycorremediation of polluted soils',
    text: `In the ecosystem, fungi play a crucial role in the decomposition and recycling of organic matter. Mycoremediation is the decontamination of an environment, such as soil, by fungi. By introducing one or more species of fungi into a polluted site, polluting molecules such as hydrocarbons or heavy metals can be removed from the soil. Unlike conventional remediation techniques, which often rely on thermal desorption and "burn" the soil to degrade or extract the pollutants, mycoremediation allows microbial and plant life to be maintained throughout the remediation process, and avoids moving large volumes of soil to a reprocessing plant.`,

    title: 'The Blob: optimised decisions, anticipation and knowledge sharing',
    text: `The Blob Physarum polycephalum is able to learn from its physical environment to adapt its development strategy and efficiently recover resources.     Physarum polycephalum is a unicellular being measuring a few centimetres to several metres in diameter. Although it does not have a brain as such, it is capable of learning from its past and solving problems related to its environment. For example, a blob can be trained to recognise table salt as "non-toxic", which enables it to learn to traverse salty environments to find food. The "blob" can pass on this knowledge to its fellow creatures by simple contact.`,

    title: `Echolocation: Seeing like bats`,
    text: `Bats have the ability to locate themselves thanks to the echo of the ultrasounds that they emit and analyse very precisely. This enables them to hunt at night. Based on this property, known as echolocation, researchers have invented a high-performance cane for the blind.`,
